## What is the real time web?

* Started with AJAX
* Comet
* Pushing data to the browser, not pulling
* HTTP is bad at this, Comet's goal is to remedy this with more normal socket behavior

## LeafyChat

* Real time IRC in browser
* Used **Orbited** <!--add a link here--> -- a pure python server to smooth over browser's lack of sockets
* Data is passed around in json packets (similar to the twilio msg packets)

_(((Alex Gaynor makes me feel inadequate)))_

* Works, some flaws:
* * Fairly messy
* * IRC and comet in the same process
* * Required updating a bunch of places to introduce changes

## DjangoDose

* Uses StompMQ -- a message queue (((based on twsited?)))
* Used an initial queue to provide data
* * This resulted in people getting a lot of extra bursts of the same data

## Hurricane

* A framework based on the notion of consumers and producers
* Huge amounts of asynchronous achitecture
* * Tornado, multiprocessing, queues, long polling oh my
* Big problems floating around abstractions for comet

## PyCon
* Like DjangoDose,
* Uses Redis
* Orbited is apparently the way to go

## THE BRAYING OF BARNYARD ANIMALS BEGINS

_(((Yes, I'm hateful, I've found that people just like to hear themselves talk once QA begins)))_

* Apparently XMPP is good?
* Orbited is semi-defunct, they're working on something new
* **Causing** (?) is another cool thing.
