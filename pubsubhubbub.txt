PubSubHubBub
============

## What is it?
* Publisher Subscriber to a Hub (Server to server over HTTP)
* Provides low latency API
* There are better and more rigorous, but this is easy and scalable
* Takes RSS and ATOM and turns them into real-time streams
_(((PubSubHubBub could be useful for book uploads or something)))_
* Uses a webhook callback URL for every update on the hub

## HOWTO
* For publishers
* * Take ATOM or RSS and add link rel='hub'
* * * AppEngine one is available, totally opensource
* * * Superfeeder
* * * Roll your own or load your own
* * Add thing to your feed, and send HTTP Post to the HUB-->HUB sends back 204 (good), 400 (you screwed up), 500 (hub screwed up)
* For subscribers
* * Parse the relation link off feed
* * Send subscribe request (basic HTTP POST) with verification stuff and callback stuff
* * Echo a challenge from HUB back to it, and you're set.
* * New stuff gets sent to you

## Building a Hub
* Accepts and verifies new topics/subscriptions
* Publisher pings
* Figures out new stuff
* Sends new content

## Scalability
* Adds more possible subscribers

## Reliability
* makes fetch &c retries in the protocol
