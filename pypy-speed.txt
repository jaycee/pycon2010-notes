The Speed of PyPy
=================

## How Fast is PyPy?

* Depends--faster in some cases, slower in others.
* * While understandable, this is sort of a non answer.

## The Just In Time Compiler

* Requires certain use cases.
* Works as a tracing JIT (similar to Java and Firefox)
* * This requires actual execution to work well

## Release

* Has the JIT
* May not do anything useful
* May eat all your memory
_(((Sounds like a winner!)))_
