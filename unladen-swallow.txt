## Why Python

* Primary Language
* * Youtube is pure python
* Believe engineers should be able to use what they want
* * But it should be fast

## Goals

* 5x increase in speed
* * Didn't hit that, but believe it's possible

## Implementation

* Apparenlty they throw away a lot of ideas like sys._getframe and exec; good in most cases sure, but if this gets merged into Python trunk it could hurt a lot of edge-case techniques.
 _(((He's had to skip a lot. Apparently was unaware of the time constraints?)))_
 _(((The implementation of **len()** scares the crap out of me.)))_
 * They reduced an approx 35 LoC implementation of **len()** down to 3 LoC, with LLVM. Very impressive.
 * It supports Django
 _((("You don't run the fibonacci sequence in your code. So one implementation does it fast than another? Who gives a damn?)))_
* 20% speed increase in Django!!!

## Looking Back

* Some points that were screwups
* * An early release that wasn't based on LLVM
* * Redid parts of the interpreter on a lot of low hanging fruit.
* * It was faster, but it introduced a changeover that scared people off.

* Why not 5x increase?
* * Switched to LLVM b/c it was supposed to see high usage (like on Apple). Which implied it was pretty stable.
* * * Incorrect assumption--a lot of bugs. 
* * * A lot of bugs.
* * * * 16 MB bytecode assumed limit.
* * Added integration in gdb; lets you step through stack frames.
* * Fixed profiling issues as well (Oprofiler_(((sp?)))_)
_(((I should probably check that profiler out.)))_
